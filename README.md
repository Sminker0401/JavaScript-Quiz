# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This page was created to quiz your knowledge on java script facts. I needed to add a timer that would add time for correct answers and less time for wrong answers.
Lastly, the site needed to show a history of top scores. The quiz was created to get myself used to testing for when I go on job interviews.
